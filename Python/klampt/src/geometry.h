/** @brief A 3D indexed triangle mesh class.
 *
 * Attributes:
 * - vertices:  a list of vertices, given as a flattened coordinate list
 *   [x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, ...]
 * - indices: a list of triangle vertices given as indices into the
 *   vertices list, i.e., [a1,b1,c2, a2,b2,c2, ...]
 *
 * Note: because the bindings are generated by SWIG, you can access
 * the indices / vertices members via some automatically generated
 * accessors / modifiers.  In particular len(), append(), and
 * indexing via [] are useful. Some other methods like resize() are
 * also provided.  However, you CANNOT set these items via assignment. 
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * m = TriangleMesh()
 * m.vertices.append(0)
 * m.vertices.append(0)
 * m.vertices.append(0)
 * print len(m.vertices)  #prints 3
 * m.vertices = [0,0,0]   #this is an error
 * m.vertices += [1,2,3]   #this is also an error

/** @brief A three-D geometry.  Can either be a reference to a
 * world item's geometry, in which case modifiers change the 
 * world item's geometry, or it can be a standalone geometry.
 *
 * Each geometry stores a "current" transform, which is automatically updated
 * for world items' geometries.  The proximity queries are performed with 
 * respect to the transformed geometries (note the underlying geometry is 
 * not changed, which could be computationally expensive.  The query is
 * performed, however, as though they were).
 *
 * If you want to set a world item's geometry to be equal to a standalone
 * geometry, use the set(rhs) function rather than the assignment (=)
 * operator.
 *
 * Modifiers include any setX() functions, translate(), and transform().
 *
 * Proximity queries include collides(), withinDistance(), distance(), 
 * closestPoint(), and rayCast().
 *
 * Each object also has a "collision margin" which may virtually fatten the
 * object, as far as proximity queries are concerned. This is useful
 * for setting collision avoidance margins in motion planning. By
 * default it is zero.  (Note that this is NOT the same thing as simulation
 * body collision padding!)
